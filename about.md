I started Krastie AI in 2024 as an AI-powered document editor (now a full-fledged content creation platform), but I've been coding for a few years before that. I started with HTML and CSS, and then moved on to JavaScript and React. I've also worked with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.


## Where it all started

In 2018 I came up with the idea of a automated marketing platform. I had no prior experience in marketing, but had some experience with coding. I started working on the project, but quickly realized I was in over my head. I ended up dropping the project, but I learned a lot from it.


I've been coding for a few years now, and I've learned a lot. I've founded several software products over the years, including:


- Rototer
- Twayobiz
- Obeatow
- Imgartfis
- [Krastie AI](https://krastie.ai)


After years of developing software in low-code platforms, I decided to use React and Node.js to build my next product Krastie AI.


Krastie AI is a content creation platform that uses AI to help you create content for your business. It's a platform that allows you to create AI content that is optimized for SEO and social media and of course drives traffic and conversions to your website.


I'm currently still working on Krastie AI to this day, and would love for you to check it out and follow my journey on [X](https://x.com/sewell_stephens).
